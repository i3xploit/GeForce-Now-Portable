# Welcome to GeForce Now Portable !

As NVIDIA does not offer a portable version of its GeForce Now application, I decided to make se repo GitHub which will allow you to download each version of GeForce Now in portable mode.



# How does it work?

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/louisgallet95/GeForce-Now-Portable/releases/tag/v2.0.23) and put it on a USB key. 
Then open the "GeForce Now" folder and then the "CEF" folder and here you will find the GeForce Now application.
